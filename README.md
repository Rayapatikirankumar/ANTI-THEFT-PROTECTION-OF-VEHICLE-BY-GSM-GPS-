# ANTI-THEFT-PROTECTION-OF-VEHICLE-BY-GSM-GPS

 The Design and Implementation of Anti-theft Protection of Vehicle by GSM & GPS with Fingerprint Verification Using
 Raspberry Pi Pico focuses on developing an intelligent and robust vehicle security system. The system integrates GSM,
 GPS, and fingerprint verification technologies with the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to prevent unauthorized access
 and enhance vehicle safety. The proposed system employs a fingerprint sensor to authenticate users, ensuring that only
 authorized individuals can start the vehicle. In the event of unauthorized access or theft, the GSM module sends real-time
 alerts to the vehicle owner's mobile device, providing critical information such as the vehicle's location via the GPS module.
 Additionally, the GPS module enables continuous tracking of the vehicle, allowing the owner to monitor its movement
 remotely. The Raspberry Pi Pico serves as the central processing unit, coordinating inputs from the fingerprint sensor and
 communication modules. It also ensures low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and easy integration. The system is
 designed to provide a user-friendly interface, secure data transmission, and quick response in emergencies. This project
 offers a practical, scalable, and affordable solution to vehicle theft, enhancing security through biometric verification and
 real-time tracking.
